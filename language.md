# Language

English is used as much as possible throughout the application. However, some brand names or business concepts do not have an English equivalent or hard to translate from Dutch to English. Some examples of such brands or concepts are: UiTPAS, Kansenstatuut, Kansentarief. To ensure these concepts stay clear, their original Dutch name is used.
