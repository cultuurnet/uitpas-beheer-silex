# Language

English is used as much as possible throughout the application. There are a few exceptions to this rule:
* Some brand names do not have an English equivalent, for example UiTPAS.
* Some business concepts are hard to translate from Dutch to English, for example Kansenstatuut and Kansentarief.

To ensure these concepts stay clear, their original Dutch name is used.
