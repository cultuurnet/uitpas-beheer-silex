# Peer review

All code should be reviewed by a colleague.

Some of the points that should be checked are:

* Code should be written and structured in a way that make it testable.
* Never use abbreviations as names, use a proper IDE that can help you with code completion. Preferably, use names that explain what a certain object is, or what a method will do.
* Don't repeat yourself.
* English should be used as [language](../language.md) throughout the code.
