# Swagger documentation

The RESTfull API of the application is documented with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/specification/).

The `swagger.json` file can be found in the [`web`](./../../web)
 directory. You can check if its well-formed with `./vendor/bin/phing swagger-validate`[^1].
 
 [^1] Requires additional tools. Run `npm install` first to install them.
