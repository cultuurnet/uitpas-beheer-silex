# Technical manual

The manual that you are currently reading, has been made with the help of [GitBook](https://help.gitbook.com/).

The GitBook Editor app, unfortunately did not behave quite well at the time of 
writing. Therefore we recommend that you use a decent MarkDown Editor[^1] or IDE[^2] instead.

Install the [GitBook CLI](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-cli) and preview the results of your edits with ``gitbook serve``.

[^1] We warmly recommend [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) for Mac users

[^2] We prefer [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) with the [GitHub markdown plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7701?pr=idea)
