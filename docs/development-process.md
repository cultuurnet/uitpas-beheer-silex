# Development process

A first important aspect in the development process, is the use of certain [Git branches](./development-process/git-workflow.md).

We also take a look at the [Definition of Done](./development-process/definition-of-done.md),
a set of agreements made to keep the application (and its documentation) sane and maintainable,
and zoom in on each of them.
