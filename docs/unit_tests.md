# Unit tests

Unit tests are written with the PHPUnit framework.

Test methods use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) naming, as opposed to the rest of the code base. This makes it easier to generate meaningful, human readable descriptions from the test cases with [PHPUnit's TestDox feature](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/other-uses-for-tests.html).
